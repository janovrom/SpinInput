## Spin Input
So I was wondering, why should I use the standard soft keyboard on Android. It's annoying as hell as you can't use it to write with more than two fingers, though there are the swipe inputs and you can easily get proficient with it. This is where the idea came in: you use just 2 fingers and the keyboard occludes too much of the space, so why not to shift it to only two corners.
